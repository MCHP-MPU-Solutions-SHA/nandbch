* Build nandbch:

    make ARCH=x86

* Clean project:

    make clean

* Clean all target files:

    make distclean

* Add new nand chip support:
    Update nand_chips[] structure array in main.c
    For example with MT29F4G08ABADAWP:
    {
      .name = "MT29F4G08ABADAWP",

         * Part number of nandflash
         * Check nand datasheet
         */

        /*
         * Nandflash page size
         * Check nand datasheet
         */
      .spare_size  = 64,
        /*
         * Nandflash spare size
         * Check nand datasheet
         */
      .ecc_sector  = 512,
        /*
         * Sector size for ECC calculation
         * By default, set to 512 bytes;
         * Or to 1024 bytes if the ECC bit capability is 0xFF
         *
         * Value of ECC sector size also could be get from nand datasheet
         */
      .ecc_bytes   = 7,
        /*
         * ECC bytes per sector
         * Get minimum ECC bits from nand datasheet, or from ONFI parameter page if supported
         * Then calculate ECC bytes by minimum ECC bits and ECC sector size
         *
         * For example:
         * MT29F4G08ABADAWP require minimum 4-bit ECC per ECC sector
         * ecc_bits = m * t
         * 2^m – 1 > bits_per_sectorsize
         * 2^m – 1 > 512 * 8
         * m = 13
         * t = min_ecc_bits = 4
         * ecc_bits = 13 * 4 = 52 bits
         * ecc bytes = 7 bytes
         */
      .ecc_addr    = -1, /* -1 means right-aligned, used as array index which start from 0 */
        /*
         * Offset address in nand oob area for ECC codes
         * Will be used as array index
         * Normally it is right-aligned
         *
         * For this nand:
         * ECC bytes = page_size / ecc_sector * ecc_bytes = 2048 / 512 * 7 = 28
         * Then address = spare_size - ECC bytes + 1 = 64 - 28 + 1 = 37
         * Cause of ecc_addr will be used as array index which start from 0
         * Then ecc_addr = address - 1 = 37 - 1 = 36
         */
